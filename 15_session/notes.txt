Notes:
-Control + Shift + J: opens web console
-Conditionals are less cost-efficient than error-handling; use conditionals to see which method was used, and thus respond accordingly (if request.method == "get")

-username: threeCoffeePeanuts
-password: oneWalnutLatte

Discoveries:
**When we're in our local site, web console displays request.obj (with /favicon), and the method, and has the heading information
-(Tentative) Have 3 functions in app.py that correspond to 1) input username + password page, 2) username/pass is incorrect page (failed), 3) username + pass is correct page (works)
-1 submit button total for username + password
-Use separate elif statements so we know which error messages to give out
