from flask import Flask             #facilitate flask webserving
from flask import render_template   #facilitate jinja templating
from flask import request           #facilitate form submission

#the conventional way:
#from flask import Flask, render_template, request

trioTASK:
~~~~~~~~~~~ BEFORE RUNNING THIS, ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
...read for understanding all of the code below.
Some will work as written; other sections will not. Can you predict which?
Devise some simple tests you can run to "take apart this engine," as it were.
Execute your tests. Process results.
PROTIP: Insert your own in-line comments wherever they will help your future self and/or current teammates understand what is going on.
