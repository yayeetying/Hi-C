-Stack lines of CSS code in inline by separating each line with a ; 
  -style="background: lightgray; color: white"
*lightgray is one word

-can specify color with word (gray), hex (#808080), and rbg (rbg(128,128,128))

**Biggest tip!!! If unsure of how margin/border/padding/contents work, INSPECT ELEMENT because it gives you all of the elements' margins/borders line by line!

-columns property: <column-width> <column-count>
  -width: defines min width for each column; count: defines max num of columns

-list-style-type: none
-^means to remove the bullet points in a list

-text-decoration: none
-^means all those pesky lil underlines (etc.) in links, disappears

-INTERNAL CSS: <style> should go in between <html> and </html>

-if id="WholeColumn," then when you're doing CSS and you want to CSS that id, do #WholeColumn{<CSS here>}

-EXTERNAL CSS sheet: include link to CSS file within head section of page
