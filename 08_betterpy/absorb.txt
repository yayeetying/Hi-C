Questions:
-How do we change Justin's code into a function?
-Was there a simpler way to read through Yaying's file without looping through each character in a string?
-If random.randint doesn't fall into a range, what happens? Would the best solution then to just be to find another random int and try again?

Comments:
-Justin's usage of floats and intervals was nice.
-Interesting to see use of randomchoices in Yaying's code (instead of other random methods)
-Yoonah's code is similar to Justin's - in her case, she multiplied everything by 10 to avoid using decimals.
-Josh added percentages repeatedly seems very efficient!
-Overall: Most members started out in similar ways to read the file and convert the contents into a dictionary. Afterwards, we also seemed to use this "intervals" idea and random number methods to get our randomized weighted probability.

Concerns:

-Justin's code mayhaps should have been a function
