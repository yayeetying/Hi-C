DISCO
- You can manually set the sizes for each cell in a grid at three breakpoints (small, medium, large)
	- Bootstrap has set sizes for breakpoints
- Grid padding x and grid padding y are automatic
- Grid x refers to a row of cells
	- If too long will snap to the next line
- Grid y refers to a column of cells
	- Snaps based on window width, not window height
	- Maintains set height for the entire grid (changes cell height)
- The auto tag automatically fills the rest of the page
- A wrapper class is needed in order to get independent scrolling bodies
- Cell sizes work similarly to Bootstrap (12 sections, number with the cell size is how many sections of the window the cell takes up)
- cell-block-container: container for inside a grid frame containing multiple blocks
* cell-block-y modifies cell to give it "block" behavior: auto overflow, vertical scrollbar
- make forms with <fieldset class = "fieldset"; include <input> and <label>
- "placeholder" in textarea for forms make it so some faded text is in the textbox

QCC
- Can you have the scrolling body work for multiple cell sizes
	- Only got it working for one size (small, medium, or large)
	- No longer a scrolling body for the other 2 sizes

Q0
- No I did not consult resources beyond the neighboring duo's on-ramp
	- Was quite simple, although there was not much to work with
	- Only had grid, padding, and independent scrolling bodies

- Yes, I did - got curious about whether Foundation could include forms, so I found the Foundation documentation for it

Q1
- Note exactly sure -> think I prefer Bootstrap more
	- Spent more time learning it myself -> more exploration into more features (rather than just what we feel are core)
		- Leads to more comfort
	- Classes that I worked with in Bootstrap seem more self-explanatory?
- Didn't work much with Foundation features
	- However quick glance at documentation -> seems to be able to provide the same features
	- Look at navbar -> seems much easier to understand compared to Bootstrap

- Feels like there is more Bootstrap documentation than Foundation documentation
  - Wanted to look up info on block-container; could not find in Foundation
  - BUT there are videos in Foundation documentation (gives visual to code)
- Grids in Foundation make more sense to me, but that might've been because I spent more time tinkering with it
* So far, I prefer Foundation more, just because it seems to make sense for me more
