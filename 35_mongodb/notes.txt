MongoDB
  - NoSQL database
  - not rows/columns/tables, but still organizes data
  - stored as documents in collections
    - documents: stores data as a set of field-value pairs
      - {
          <field>: <value>,
          <field>: <value>
        }
      - <field> is similar to an identifier
    - documents kinda similar to dictionary? Or JSON formatted thing
    - collections: organized store of documents

Atlas Cloud Database
  - data storage & retrieval
  - deploy clusters - group of servers that store data
    - in replica set: connected MongoDB instances (machines) that store same data
      - 1 instance fails, you have other machines in replica set!
  - manages cluster creation, and runs and maintains databases

**user and pass in notebook
- connect to Atlas cluster --> MongoDB shell installed already --> version 4.4
