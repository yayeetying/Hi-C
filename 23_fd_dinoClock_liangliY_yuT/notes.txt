DISCO
- You can manually set the sizes for each cell in a grid at three breakpoints (small, medium, large)
	- Bootstrap has set sizes for breakpoints
- Grid padding x and grid padding y are automatic
- Grid x refers to a row of cells
	- If too long will snap to the next line
- Grid y refers to a column of cells
	- Snaps based on window width, not window height
	- Maintains set height for the entire grid (changes cell height)
- The auto tag automatically fills the rest of the page
- A wrapper class is needed in order to get independent scrolling bodies
- Cell sizes work similarly to Bootstrap (12 sections, number with the cell size is how many sections of the window the cell takes up)

QCC
- Can you have the scrolling body work for multiple cell sizes
	- Only got it working for one size (small, medium, or large)
	- No longer a scrolling body for the other 2 sizes

Q0
- No I did not consult resources beyond the neighboring duo's on-ramp
	- Was quite simple, although there was not much to work with
	- Only had grid, padding, and independent scrolling bodies

Q1
- Note exactly sure -> think I prefer Bootstrap more
	- Spent more time learning it myself -> more exploration into more features (rather than just what we feel are core)
		- Leads to more comfort
	- Classes that I worked with in Bootstrap seem more self-explanatory?
- Didn't work much with Foundation features
	- However quick glance at documentation -> seems to be able to provide the same features
	- Look at navbar -> seems much easier to understand compared to Bootstrap
