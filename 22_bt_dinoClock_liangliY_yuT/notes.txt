- Each type of class (container, table, form, btn) has many subclasses
  - The stylings applied are dependent on the class
    - Will contain keywords/phrases to dictate size, color, exact purpose
    - Example: lg, sm are sizes for containers
  * Classes are built upon the already existing HTML tags.

- All aspects of styling are designed to change size alongside the browser window's size.

- The Navbar button (for the navbar heading) has many different parts
  - Not sure exaclty what each part does.

- to use root variables from bootstrap, do var(<variable name>)
  - ie. background: var(--bs-blue)
