#K<06> -- Reading CSV Files
#2021-09-28

#Our program starts by reading the file and removing the new lines off each occupation in the CSV file.
#Because some of the jobs have commas (outside of separating the job and the percentage), we decided to
#manually split the lines. For every line in the file, go through every char in the line, and if we
#see a comma and it's not part of the quoted info, add that value to the temporary storing list.
#if we see a comma and it is within the quotes, don't separate - keep adding the char into our temp.
#storing String. Add info in temp. list to our dictionary, and get weighted choices using random.choices.

#for random.choices, population (list of "choices") and weights (list of the weights
#of these choices) must be of the same list size
