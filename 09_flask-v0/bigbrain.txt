K09 -- Observations With First Python App
2021-10-03

Q0: We have seen similar syntax in Java when learning about inheritance. Following that idea, it looks like we're making an instance of the Flask class and calling it app.

Q1: '/' usually describes the path to a particular file. '/' signifies going into a subfolder.

Q2: _name_ will print to the terminal.

Q3: No, this will not appear anywhere. Nothing is being printed; the function hello_world is simply returning "No hablo queso!" We can use return values elsewhere (ie. in another function), but it won't be printed automatically.

Q4: .run() is seen in both Python and in Java. However, in Java, run() would refer to a method written by the user.

Observations (Josephine):
- I got this information:
* Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
- I tried getting rid of the error using "export FLASK_ENV=development" (https://www.educba.com/flask-environment-variables/)
but I got this message:
'export' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file

Observations (Yaying):
- when creating my virtual environment, I had to include the path of the folder in addition to its name
** I needed to write python3 in the terminal instead of just python when creating the virtual environment - I'm probably one of those kids who have python2 and python3 installed in my computer, and it can't differentiate between which version I'm calling.
- if I didn't include a name for the virtual environment, it seems like it just takes on the name of the directory above it
- also got same warning as Josephine!
