* requestID is like an identifier -- it's not about the number of frames or sumn
* requestID = window.requestAnimationFrame(<fxn>)
  * before browser renders the next frame, call the function held at the variable drawDot
  * returns a long that uniquely identifies the callback
* window.cancelAnimationFrame(requestID) ==> undefined
  * cancels animation frame referred to by requestID
